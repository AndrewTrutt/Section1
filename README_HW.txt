hello world!


Answer to the HW problem 4:

After I merged feature_branch_HW with main, I saw that the changes were updated in the main branch on github. I of course also saw the changes locally because that is where I made them.

After I modified the README file on github (in the main branch), and then pulled to my local machine, the changes were once again updated on my local machine.
